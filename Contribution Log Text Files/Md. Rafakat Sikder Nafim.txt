My contribution to our project is very little. But we tried to follow the agile method. Our project was so small that the other members did almost most of the project's task. I was in charge of the 3d model and for creating the vuforia database for our project's marker. This was a very small role to play in our project. So I was acting as a customer giving feedbacks about our project to the other members so that they can make necessary changes in order to make the project much better. I figured out the bug that the apps doesn't work properly if the android device has bad camera and in low light. I immediately reported this to the other members of the group who were in charge of this field.

My biggest challege was using bitbucket like most of the members in my group. It was a huge pain for me. Every thing starting with add to commit seemed very much confusing for me. Other than that getting to know vuforia how to make a marker database for our project was exciting for me as I have never used vuforia or such platform before. I asked my teammates to make an IOS version for our project but it seemed unnecessary and time consuming at the end of the semester so we had to abort this decision.
