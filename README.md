Project Type: Augmented Reality

For our project, we will be using Unity Engine and Vuforia development kit (SDK) in order to develop an Augmented Reality application for android platform. The application would recognize certain images which would be fixed by us and upon those images 3D Models (A ball for an example) would appear whose movement we could control. This would be a Marker based Augmented Reality Project.
